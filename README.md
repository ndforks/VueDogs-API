# VueDogs-API

This is just a small hack to test BrewDogs API and to play around with Vue 2.1.x and Webpack 2.2.x

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3333
node server

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production with minification and watch
npm run build -- -w
```
